Lets begin with the first challenge in the web category. 
For many of you this might be their first ctf so let me show you the interface. 
First Up is the challenge name. Then there are the points for the challenge. Then it shows the tags for the challenges. It is followed by a short description and a website or the attachments. Below that is the author's name.

Here we have a flag.... Lets submit it! On submitting it we know that it is a fake flag! 
Let's go back to the website. We have a blurred flag here! And no I did not blur it.

Here Look at this code snippet! We can easily see another span class. But I don't see a flag here! The span class looks weird. Let's wrap flag around it and submit it. 
Thus the flag is flag{poefKukjNPojzLDf}
Voila! We got It! You just solved your first challenge in a CTF! Have Fun!
