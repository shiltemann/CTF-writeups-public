In addition, since UA is about to be deprecated on Jul 1, 2023, the Page Views feature of Chirpy will also be deprecated at that time.This post is to enable Page Views on the Chirpy theme based blog that you just built. This requires technical knowledge and it’s recommended to keep the google_analytics.pv.* empty unless you have a good reason. If your website has low traffic, the page views count would discourage you to write more blogs. With that said, let’s start with the setup.Set up Google AnalyticsCreate GA account and propertyFirst, you need to set up your account on Google analytics. While you create your account, you must create your first Property as well. Head to https://analytics.google.com/ and click on Start Measuring Enter your desired Account Name and choose the desired checkboxes Enter your desired Property Name. This is the name of the tracker project that appears on your Google Analytics dashboard Enter the required information About your business Hit Create and accept any license popup to set up your Google Analytics account and create your propertyCreate Data StreamWith your property created, you now need to set up Data Stream to track your blog traffic. After you signup, the prompt should automatically take you to create your first Data Stream. If not, follow these steps: Go to Admin on the left column Select the desired property from the drop-down on the second column Click on Data Streams Add a stream and click on Web Enter your blog’s URLIt should look like this:Now, click on the new data stream and grab the Measurement ID. It should look something like G-V6XXXXXXXX. Copy this to your _config.yml file:google_analytics: id: 'G-V6XXXXXXX' # fill in your Google Analytics ID # Google Analytics pageviews report settings pv: proxy_endpoint: # fill in the Google Analytics superProxy endpoint of Google App Engine cache_path: # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionWhen you push these changes to your blog, you should start seeing the traffic on your Google Analytics. Play around with the Google Analytics dashboard to get familiar with the options available as it takes like 5 mins to pick up your changes. You should now be able to monitor your traffic in real time.Setup Page ViewsThere is a detailed tutorial available to set up Google Analytics superProxy. But, if you are interested to just quickly get your Chirpy-based blog display page views, follow along. These steps were tested on a Linux machine. If you are running Windows, you can use the Git bash terminal to run Unix-like commands.Setup Google App Engine Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine Click on Create Application Click on Create Project Enter the name and choose the data center close to you Select Python language and Standard environment Enable billing account. Yeah, you have to link your credit card. But, you won’t be billed unless you exceed your free quota. For a simple blog, the free quota is more than sufficient. Go to your App Engine dashboard on your browser and select API &amp; Services from the left navigation menu Click on Enable APIs and Services button on the top Enable the following APIs: Google Analytics API On the left, Click on OAuth Consent Screen and accept Configure Consent Screen. Select External since your blog is probably hosted for the public. Click on Publish under Publishing Status Click on Credentials on the left and create a new OAuth Client IDs credential. Make sure to add an entry under Authorized redirect URIs that matches: https://&lt;project-id&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.r.appspot.com/admin/auth Note down the Your Client ID and Your Client Secret. You’ll need this in the next section. Download and install the cloud SDK for your platform: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart Run the following commands: [root@bc96abf71ef8 /]# gcloud init~snip~Go to the following link in your browser: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&amp;client_id=XYZ.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;redirect_uri=ABCDEFGEnter verification code: &lt;VERIFICATION CODE THAT YOU GET AFTER YOU VISIT AND AUTHENTICATE FROM THE ABOVE LINK&gt;You are logged in as: [blah_blah@gmail.com].Pick cloud project to use:[1] chirpy-test-300716[2] Create a new projectPlease enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match listitem): 1[root@bc96abf71ef8 /]# gcloud info# Your selected project info should be displayed here Setup Google Analytics superProxy Clone the Google Analytics superProxy project on Github: https://github.com/googleanalytics/google-analytics-super-proxy to your local. Remove the first 2 lines in the src/app.yaml file: - application: your-project-id- version: 1 In src/config.py, add the OAUTH_CLIENT_ID and OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET that you gathered from your App Engine Dashboard. Enter any random key for XSRF_KEY, your config.py should look similar to this #!/usr/bin/python2.7__author__ = 'pete.frisella@gmail.com (Pete Frisella)'# OAuth 2.0 Client SettingsAUTH_CONFIG = { 'OAUTH_CLIENT_ID': 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', 'OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET': 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET', 'OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI': '%s%s' % ( 'https://chirpy-test-XXXXXX.ue.r.appspot.com', '/admin/auth' )}# XSRF SettingsXSRF_KEY = 'OnceUponATimeThereLivedALegend' You can configure a custom domain instead of https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com.But, for the sake of keeping it simple, we will be using the Google provided default URL. From inside the src/ directory, deploy the app [root@bc96abf71ef8 src]# gcloud app deployServices to deploy:descriptor: [/tmp/google-analytics-super-proxy/src/app.yaml]source: [/tmp/google-analytics-super-proxy/src]target project: [chirpy-test-XXXX]target service: [default]target version: [VESRION_NUM]target url: [https://chirpy-test-XXXX.ue.r.appspot.com]Do you want to continue (Y/n)?

Add a /admin to the end of the URL. Click on Authorize Users and make sure to add yourself as a managed user. If you get any errors, please Google it. The errors are self-explanatory and should be easy to fix. If everything went good, you’ll get this screen:Create Google Analytics QueryHead to https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/admin and create a query after verifying the account. GA Core Reporting API query request can be created in Query Explorer.The query parameters are as follows: start-date: fill in the first day of blog posting end-date: fill in today (this is a parameter supported by GA Report, which means that it will always end according to the current query date) metrics: select ga:pageviews dimensions: select ga:pagePathIn order to reduce the returned results and reduce the network bandwidth, we add custom filtering rules 1: filters: fill in ga:pagePath=~^/posts/.*/$;ga:pagePath!@=. Among them, ; means using logical AND to concatenate two rules. If the site.baseurl is specified, change the first filtering rule to ga:pagePath=~^/BASE_URL/posts/.*/$, where BASE_URL is the value of site.baseurl. After Run Query, copy the generated contents of API Query URI at the bottom of the page and fill in the Encoded URI for the query of SuperProxy on GAE.After the query is saved on GAE, a Public Endpoint (public access address) will be generated, and we will get the query result in JSON format when accessing it. Finally, click Enable Endpoint in Public Request Endpoint to make the query effective, and click Start Scheduling in Scheduling to start the scheduled task.Configure Chirpy to Display Page ViewOnce all the hard part is done, it is very easy to enable the Page View on Chirpy theme. Your superProxy dashboard should look something like below and you can grab the required values.Update the _config.yml file of Chirpy project with the values from your dashboard, to look similar to the following:google_analytics: id: 'G-V6XXXXXXX' # fill in your Google Analytics ID pv: proxy_endpoint: 'https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/query?id=&lt;ID FROM SUPER PROXY&gt;' cache_path: # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionNow, you should see the Page View enabled on your blog.Reference Google Analytics Core Reporting API: Filters &#8617; " }, { "title": "Customize the Favicon", "url": "/CTF-writeups-public/posts/customize-the-favicon/", "categories": "Blogging, Tutorial", "tags": "favicon", "date": "2019-08-10 18:34:00 +0200", "snippet": "The favicons of Chirpy are placed in the directory assets/img/favicons/.

Git also needs to be installed.InstallationCreating a New SiteThere are two ways to create a new repository for this theme: Using the Chirpy Starter - Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing. GitHub Fork - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade. Unless you are familiar with Jekyll and are determined to tweak or contribute to this project, this approach is not recommended.Option 1. Using the Chirpy StarterSign in to GitHub and browse to Chirpy Starter, click the button Use this template &gt; Create a new repository, and name the new repository USERNAME.github.io, where USERNAME represents your GitHub username.Option 2. GitHub ForkSign in to GitHub to fork Chirpy, and then rename it to USERNAME.github.io (USERNAME means your username).Next, clone your site to local machine. In order to build JavaScript files later, we need to install Node.js, and then run the tool:$ bash tools/init If you don’t want to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append option --no-gh at the end of the above command.The above command will: Check out the code to the latest tag (to ensure the stability of your site: as the code for the default branch is under development). Remove non-essential sample files and take care of GitHub-related files. Build JavaScript files and export to assets/js/dist/, then make them tracked by Git. Automatically create a new commit to save the changes above.Installing DependenciesBefore running local server for the first time, go to the root directory of your site and run:$ bundleUsageConfigurationUpdate the variables of _config.yml as needed. Some of them are typical options: url avatar timezone langCustomizing StylesheetIf you need to customize the stylesheet, copy the theme’s assets/css/style.scss to the same path on your Jekyll site, and then add the custom style at the end of it.Starting with version 4.1.0, if you want to overwrite the SASS variables defined in _sass/addon/variables.scss, copy the main sass file _sass/jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss into the _sass directory in your site’s source, then create a new file _sass/variables-hook.scss and assign new value.Customing Static AssetsStatic assets configuration was introduced in version 5.1.0. The CDN of the static assets is defined by file _data/assets/cross_origin.yml, and you can replace some of them according to the network conditions in the region where your website is published.Also, if you’d like to self-host the static assets, please refer to the chirpy-static-assets.Running Local ServerYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:$ bundle exec jekyll sOr run the site on Docker with the following command:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\ -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll serveAfter a few seconds, the local service will be published at http://127.0.0.1:4000.DeploymentBefore the deployment begins, check out the file _config.yml and make sure the url is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the project site and don’t use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to change the baseurl to your project name that starts with a slash, e.g, /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy by Using GitHub ActionsThere are a few things to get ready for. If you’re on the GitHub Free plan, keep your site repository public. If you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repository, and your local machine is not running Linux, go the the root of your site and update the platform list of the lock-file: $ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux Next, configure the Pages service. Browse to your repository on GitHub. Select the tab Settings, then click Pages in the left navigation bar. Then, in the Source section (under Build and deployment), select GitHub Actions from the dropdown menu. Push any commits to GitHub to trigger the Actions workflow. In the Actions tab of your repository, you should see the workflow Build and Deploy running. Once the build is complete and successful, the site will be deployed automatically. At this point, you can go to the URL indicated by GitHub to access your site.Manually Build and DeployOn self-hosted servers, you cannot enjoy the convenience of GitHub Actions. Therefore, you should build the site on your local machine and then upload the site files to the server.Go to the root of the source project, and build your site as follows:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bOr build the site on Docker:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --env JEKYLL_ENV=production \\ --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\ jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll buildUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder _site of the project’s root directory. Now you should upload those files to the target server." }, { "title": "Writing a New Post", "url": "/CTF-writeups-public/posts/write-a-new-post/", "categories": "Blogging, Tutorial", "tags": "writing", "date": "2019-08-08 08:10:00 +0200", "snippet": "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the Chirpy template, and it’s worth reading even if you’ve used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and P...", "content": "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the Chirpy template, and it’s worth reading even if you’ve used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase--- The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Adding author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn’t have this file, don’t hesitate to create one).&lt;author_id&gt;: name: &lt;full name&gt; twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt; url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then use author to specify a single entry or authors to specify multiple entries:---author: &lt;author_id&gt; # for single entry# orauthors: [&lt;author1_id&gt;, &lt;author2_id&gt;] # for multiple entries---Having said that, the key author can also identify multiple entries. The benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" } For an SVG, you have to at least specify its width, otherwise it won’t be rendered.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right. Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added. Normal position Image will be left aligned in below sample: ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal } Float to the left ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left } Float to the right ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right } Dark/Light modeYou can make images follow theme preferences in dark/light mode. This requires you to prepare two images, one for dark mode and one for light mode, and then assign them a specific class (dark or light):![Light mode only](/path/to/light-mode.png){: .light }![Dark mode only](/path/to/dark-mode.png){: .dark }ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Image PathWhen a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:---img_path: /img/path/---And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png)The output will be:&lt;img src=\"/img/path/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Preview ImageIf you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of 1200 x 630. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet 1.91 : 1, the image will be scaled and cropped.Knowing these prerequisites, you can start setting the image’s attribute:---image: path: /path/to/image alt: image alternative text---Note that the img_path can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the attribute path only needs the image file name.For simple use, you can also just use image to define the path.---image: /path/to/image---LQIPFor preview images:---image: lqip: /path/to/lqip-file # or base64 URI--- You can observe LQIP in the preview image of post Text and Typography.For normal images:![Image description](/path/to/image){: lqip=\"/path/to/lqip-file\" }Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type info as follows:&gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-info }SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Hightlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value``` The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho 'No more line numbers!'```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=\"path/to/file\" }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %} This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.VideosYou can embed a video with the following syntax:{% include embed/{Platform}.html id='{ID}' %}Where Platform is the lowercase of the platform name, and ID is the video ID.The following table shows how to get the two parameters we need in a given video URL, and you can also know the currently supported video platforms.

format: The three large squares highlighted in red are the position markers.These tell the scanner where the edges of the code are. The smaller red square is an alignment marker. This acts as areference point for the scanner, making sure everything lines upproperly. In bigger codes, there are several of these squares. The red strips of alternating black and white modules are calledtiming patterns. They define the positioning of the rows and columns. The green sections determine the format. This tells the scannerwhether it’s a website, text message, Chinese symbols, numbers, or anycombination of these. The modules highlighted in blue represent the version number.Basically, the more modules in the code, the higher the version (up tov40, which is 177×177 modules). If the code is version 6 or smaller,the version does not need to be defined here because the scanner canliterally count the modules and determine the version on its own.It appears that the pixels in a circular area in the middle or theQRcode need to be inverted in order to create the three position markersin the corners.After we do that, we see we need to apply the same trick again with asmaller circle in order to fix the alignment marker.We can do this in GIMP:which gets us the following QR code:" }, { "title": "Every-Thing", "url": "/CTF-writeups-public/writeups/HackyEaster_2019/16-every-thing.html", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "", "snippet": "ChallengeAfter the brilliant idea from here.The data model is stable and you can really store Every-Thing.EveryThing.zipSolutionEgg", "content": "ChallengeAfter the brilliant idea from here.The data model is stable and you can really store Every-Thing.EveryThing.zipSolutionEgg" }, { "title": "Virtual Box 4", "url": "/CTF-writeups-public/writeups/ABCTF-2016/16-virtual-series-60-virtual-box-4.html", "categories": "virtual series", "tags": "", "date": "", "snippet": "Challenge What’s this?Solution There was a file named whats this in recycle bin, restored it, foundit originated from location C:\\Program Files\\OutlookExpress\\ABCTF{Y0U_F0UND_ME}", "content": "Challenge What’s this?Solution There was a file named whats this in recycle bin, restored it, foundit originated from location C:\\Program Files\\OutlookExpress\\ABCTF{Y0U_F0UND_ME}" }, { "title": "Spaghetti hash", "url": "/CTF-writeups-public/writeups/HackyEaster_2017/17-challenge-20-spaghetti-hash.html", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "", "snippet": "ChallengeLazy Larry needs to improve the security of his password hashingimplementation.

Easter developed an alternative.He’s proudly introducing the “Cony Code” now! Crack the code in order toget another easter egg!Hint: 110 is blue, the rest’s up to you…Solution:The hint suggest we can substitute each coloured square for a 3-digitbinary number, we just need to figure out the binary codes correspondingto each colour.Since blue is 110, it could be inverted RGB? (i.e. red=011, green=101,blue=110, etc..)following this logic we get the following rules:red = 011 (= r )green = 101 (= g )blue = 110 (= b )yellow = 001 (= y )magenta = 010 (= m )cyan = 100 (= c )black = 111 (= bl)white = 000 (= w )the image has the following colors:r-m-w-bl-m-y-b-c-r-c-w-r-g-wg-bl-y-r-b-b-c-y-c-y-r-w-b-bg-g-bl-y-r-y-m-b-w-g-b-r-r-gw-b-m-g-b-m-y-r-c-b-c-y-c-yr-w-b-b-g-g-g-y-r-r-c-b-r-cg-g-r-r-w-b-w-g-c-m-y-r-c-by-g-g-bl-r-r-m-m-bl-g-g-w-r-wm-b-y-g-g-r-r-b-m-b-m-g-c-yr-c-b-bl-m-y-c-g-r-c-c-m-bl-gg-y-r-r-m-b-w-g-c-bl-r-y-m-bly-c-g-bl-r-y-m-b-r-g-c-bl-m-blb-r-y-w-b-y-m-bl-b-b-g-w-b-blr-y-b-r-r-w-b-bl-m-b-c-m-bl-yb-w-r-r-c-b-r-c-c-w-bl-bl-bl-blSubstituting the colours with the binary codes gives us:011010000111010001110100011100000011101000101111001011110110100001100001011000110110101101111001011001010110000101110011011101000110010101110010001011100110100001100001011000110110101101101001011011100110011100101101011011000110000101100010001011100110001101101111011011010010111101101000011000010110001101101011011110010110010101100001011100110111010001100101011100100010111101101001011011010110000101100111011001010111001100101111011001010110011101100111010111110011001000110001010111110110101000110111011001110011011000110111010110100010111001110000011011100110011100100000111111111111which, when translated to ascii gives (removing the trailing 1s):http://hackyeaster.hacking-lab.com/hackyeaster/images/egg_21_j7g67Z.png" }, { "title": "Scrambled Egg", "url": "/CTF-writeups-public/writeups/HackyEaster_2019/20-scrambled-egg.html", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "", "snippet": "ChallengeSolutionEgg", "content": "ChallengeSolutionEgg" }, { "title": "L33t H4xx0r", "url": "/CTF-writeups-public/writeups/ABCTF-2016/20-web-exploitation-70-l33t-h4xx0r.html", "categories": "web", "tags": "", "date": "", "snippet": "ChallengeIf you could bypass the login you could get the flag.

Can you prove they are wrong?Create a string which produces the following hash:757c479895d6845b2b0530cd9a2b11Specification:Solution:From the specification we see we need to find a 30-character string suchthat:MD2( inputString[0-5] ) = targetString[0-5] (= 757c47)MD5( inputString[6-11] ) = targetString[6-11] (= 9895d6)SHA1( inputString[12-27] ) = targetString[12-17] (= 845b2b)SHA256( inputString[18-23] ) = targetString[18-23] (= 0530cd)SHA512( inputString[24-29] ) = targetString[24-29] (= 9a2b11)So we need to find 5 6-character strings which when hashed produce thedesired outcome, and then concatenate them.We bruteforce 6-character strings until we find a matching input foreach hash type:import itertoolsfrom Crypto.Hash import MD2,MD5,SHA,SHA256,SHA512charset = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'for i in itertools.product(charset, repeat=6): MD2hash = MD2.new(''.join(i)).hexdigest() MD5hash = MD5.new(''.join(i)).hexdigest() SHA1hash = SHA.new(''.join(i)).hexdigest() SHA256hash = SHA256.new(''.join(i)).hexdigest() SHA512hash = SHA512.new(''.join(i)).hexdigest() if MD2hash.startswith('757c47'): print 'MD2: '+''.join(i)+' '+MD2hash if MD5hash[6:].startswith('9895d6'): print 'MD5: '+''.join(i)+' '+MD5hash if SHA1hash[12:].startswith('845b2b'): print 'SHA1: '+''.join(i)+' '+SHA1hash if SHA256hash[18:].startswith('0530cd'): print 'SHA256: '+''.join(i)+' '+SHA256hash if SHA512hash[24:].startswith('9a2b11'): print 'SHA512: '+''.join(i)+' '+SHA512hashWe let this run for a couple minutes until one hit for each hashalgorithm is found:output:MD5: aaqidt 46e0109895d6278b858d2161a53d6163MD2: afpmqt 757c47d05a0d3effdd7102323912fed7SHA512: af9pt3 112cace752c20eaa6cd66ab29a2b1195ffd375a7a0f80a7cf0aa5bb295119d6e9f251f61be772dc848f9a21fdaeabf122128b54d13b2f200fb513a3c1c69caf7MD5: ahaelu 6b02a89895d63a26836b34d9e041520dSHA512: aick61 fe59ce23a7860e0f87d898849a2b111d938010054ac505bc428eb1ed134f5a337025cfe47be2272585a239fe85d4390e1b86fd1393ddcdd0ec32c549058129cbMD2: albkyq 757c47edf09c10f213f8a8028d8b2fa1MD5: amlp1i 5546e09895d684095e0993da825520cdSHA256: angeca e77a4a14b3946679280530cd08ed8843265b07d7828d411c06359bfc7113bc1cMD5: aor7e3 6db1079895d69d81efc0fb41200a8731MD2: ao45aq 757c4778d66b2936ec81b46f6f0a41bdSHA256: apt877 8084b4b49e86b5b5ab0530cd320762fc21ef339b2d66c1df72ebaf6c6086ed30SHA256: arlh5t ca6d3501b11a2b6e910530cd17c3c47a97980097e2ae87f3ceea52af504a6ae7MD5: awbzbv 71e2d99895d6492b26585cb718228f82SHA1: aww8nt c9f3a96a6c2f845b2b24a61cad2ade37528bca39...we concatenate an answer for each hash typeMD2-MD5-SHA1-SHA256-SHA512, for example:afpmqtaaqidtaww8ntangecaaick61.

Those values are all interrelated, set of linearequations?-&gt; yep, need to brush up on modular arithmetic I thinkwhat we know about RSA: A public key is composed of the pair (N,e) - the modulus N and thepublic exponent e A private key is composed of the pair (N,d) - the modulus N andthe private exponent d Decrypting a ciphertext is taking the integer value of a ciphertext tothe private exponent and applying modulo N to it - c^d mod N = m Encrypting a message is taking the integer value of a message to thepublic exponent and applying modulo N to it - m^e mod N = c A modulus N is composed of a multiplication of two (large) primenumbers p and q This multiplication is a trapdoor - easy in one way (multiplication),difficult in the other (factoring) The totien phi(N) can be calculated as follows: phi(N) = phi(p*q) =(p-1)*(q-1) The public exponent e is chosen in the range [3,phi(N)[, often65537 as it is in this case The private exponent d is calculated using the phi(N) modularmultiplicative inverse of e so that e*d = 1 mod phi(N) Private components are therefore p, q, d and phi(N) Public components are therefore e and N OAEP Padding is used to avoid several attacks against RSA" }, { "title": "Encryption Service", "url": "/CTF-writeups-public/writeups/ABCTF-2016/36-cryptography-140-encryption-service.html", "categories": "crypto", "tags": "", "date": "", "snippet": "ChallengeSee if you can break this!!You can connect with nc 107.170.122.6 7765 and the source can be foundhere:#/usr/bin/env pythonfrom Crypto.Cipher.AES import AESCipherimport SocketServer,threadi...", "content": "ChallengeSee if you can break this!!You can connect with nc 107.170.122.6 7765 and the source can be foundhere:#/usr/bin/env pythonfrom Crypto.Cipher.AES import AESCipherimport SocketServer,threading,os,timeimport signalfrom secret2 import FLAG, KEYPORT = 7765def pad(s): l = len(s) needed = 16 -

This is one of the first vulnerabilities used toexploit software. Modern programming languages tend to provideprotection against this type of vulnerability, but it is still observedcommonly in low-level software.Buffer overflows can be a complex vulnerability to understand andexploit due to their low-level nature. To assist you in your training,we have provided a memory simulation in the middle to help youunderstand what happens when your input in the textbox is passed to theprogram on the left. The simulation shows you the memory layout of theunderlying process, where your buffer is red, and the secret value isgreen. Try entering values into the box and observe how the values thatthe program sees change on the left.In this case, the buffer sits on top of the stack memory, with thevariable secret sitting just below it. As you will observe, the sizelimitation placed on buffer is not enforced, allowing you to write morethan 16 characters. Get a feel for buffer overflows by exploring theabove code.Once you are comfortable with buffer overflows, exploit the program togrant you the flag.overflow.cInstructions Hello world!In the textbox in the middle, try entering Hello World!. Observewhich variable within the code takes the value. Overflow!What happens if you write more than 16 characters into the buffer?Can you make the secret change? Take controlCan you make secret take the value 1633771873 (0x61616161). Notethat strings are stored in ASCII, and in ASCII, character number0x61 is a. Little endianIn most architectures, integers are read in reverse byte order frommemory, in a method which is called Little endian. Can you make thesecret take the value 1633837924 (0x61626364)?

You will be prompted toenter a date that was significant in the pirate’s life at a givengeographical location. Use your Dial-A-Pirate wheel to match up the topand bottom halves of the pirate face you see on the screen. Then, locatethe window on the wheel that matches the geographical location mentioneson the screen. Using the keyboard, type the date you see in the window.Don’t lose your Dial-A-Pirate wheel!

His works are credited with developing the scientific method and remained influential through the scientific revolution.Bacon has been called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued science could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. Although his practical ideas about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method. This method was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology.Bacon was the first recipient of the Queen’s counsel designation, whichwas conferred in 1597 when Elizabeth I of England reserved Bacon as herlegal advisor. After the accession of James VI and I in 1603, Bacon wasknighted. He was later created Baron Verulam in 1618 and Viscount St.Alban in 1621. Because he had no heirs, both titles became extinct uponhis death in 1626, at 65 years.

Traditionally, this codepoint is just a zero-width non-breaking space that inhibits line-breaking between word-glyphs. As such, if the BOM character appears in the middle of a data stream, Unicode says it should be interpreted as a normal codepoint, not as a BOM. Since Unicode 3.2, this usage has been deprecated in favor of U+2060 WORD JOINER.[1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_markSo this is ,, incredibly invalid utf16. Fun!

He is also depicted as the most aggressive ghost who always chases Pac-Man, and is hard to shake once he starts. He can have a temper, and is good friends with Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.

We cannot use ascii letters for variable name, so we use ßß=''+[][1]+!1+{}; // \"undefinedfalse[object Object]\"// coneʸislandß[19]+ß[15]+ß[1]+ß[3]+'ʸ'+ß[5]+ß[12]+ß[11]+ß[10]+ß[1]+ß[2]So we enter the following string in the password box, and get our flag!ß=''+[][1]+!1+{};ß[19]+ß[15]+ß[1]+ß[3]+'ʸ'+ß[5]+ß[12]+ß[11]+ß[10]+ß[1]+ß[2]Note: first we used ß=''!1++[][1]+{};

Their wiki makes for some fun reading, especially the issue that is linked where Andrey asserts quite strongly that developers will only ever load trusted YAML.Not sure if we need to do this sort of setup with our own class hosted somewhere?, that seems excessive since we don’t really need RCE, and we know which classes we can work with.Here’s the script I have so far:t = f\"\"\"!!com.hackyeaster.digitalsnakeart.Flagimage: snakes_at_the_beachname: &amp;K sneksource: asdfsource: *Kresolution: 256x256\"\"\".strip()print(t)query = base64.b64encode(t.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')print(query)res = requests.get(\"http://ch.hackyeaster.com:2307/art?art=\" + query).text.split('\\n')for x in res: if '&lt;h' in x: print(x) if '&lt;img' in x: digest = hashlib.md5(x.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest() if digest == \"6bb27636aafe5e67fdc4ce31ff771942\": print(\"404 error\") else: print(digest)but it seems to accept any value for the !!com bit so I guess I’m not doing that right. Looking at how python does it so I don’t have to read java:class A: def __init__(self, a=0): self.a = aclass Z(int): passclass B: def __init__(self, a): self.a = aimport yamlb = B(A(a=Z(1)))print(yaml.dump(b))produces the following yaml:!!python/object:__main__.Ba: !!python/object:__main__.A a: !!python/object/new:__main__.Z - 1ExploitingOk so com.hackyeaster.digitalsnakeart.Flag is a super class of Image, so we just need to first annotate that it’s an image:!!com.hackyeaster.digitalsnakeart.SnakeArtimage: !!com.hackyeaster.digitalsnakeart.Flag- 42name:- &amp;K sneksource: asdfsource: *Kresolution: 256x256Apparently, judging by the python above, you can just pass class arguments as a list (?!?!) and that’s equivalent to passing an argument by itself.You can see I was testing other common yaml nonsense like references to see if that was the solution but no joy.name: snekname:- snekFor some reason these are equivalent? That’s kinda wild to me.

And indeed, ROT13 of that is ttle Bun ..could very well be “little Bunny”!(“Ohaal” was also in our ciphertext file!). We set that as part of output 1 (since we theorized the fourth line, here output 2, contains the crib we used)Step 2Next we guess that the plaintext is indeed little Bunny, ROT13 that (yvggyr Ohaal), and now use that as the crib, so that hopefully we can reveal someof the letters around our he2023{ string:We see that vs ur2023{pe1 is among the results, which is is he2023{cr1 ROT13 decoded, that looks promising!Step 3We can keep guessing here, maybe is he2023{cr1 -&gt; flag is he2023{cr1b? ..but we can also fill in what we know using one of the other ciphertext linesFor example, using a combination of line 2 and 4, and using vs ur2023{pe1 as a crib, we get a result of l nyy bs uvz which translates to y all of himStep 4We continue in this way until we slowly reveal all the plaintext, doing this for the various different combinations of cipher text lines simultaneously, slowlyextending and guessing more plaintext, seeing if it works in the other encrypted lines.FinalAfter a while we are able to fully decrypt the 4 messages:626b34041c11143a444e1b342c0e341036592d39044a0c102505145b57030c1b0e15290a533231071f71040465221023026bv unir n yvggyr Ohaal jvgu n pbng nf fbsg nf qbjai have a little Bunny with a coat as soft as down7a2a304a14115a311d5b4d3d320e66520a11392e124a1000621a414310014e070245350f147431150a7105142273103a4328132f01181enaq arneyl nyy bs uvz vf juvgr rkprcg bar ovg bs oebjaand nearly all of him is white except one bit of brown733e334a0615513203170a263d1632100f506c3f1d18461c2015554316074e1f1c47264c257427061f71080a2273103a4328043c47gur svefg guvat va gur zbeavat jura V trg bhg bs orqthe first thing in the morning when I get out of bed626b2b081412463144411e733e0574004b0237280d5b09393315004103050f2a5d6a240943272513592c4a142373153c11670534050d1ev jbaqre vs ur2023{pe1o_qe4ttva_4_ce0svg!} vf gur synti wonder if he2023{cr1b_dr4ggin_4_pr0fit!} is the flag" }, { "title": "Hello World!", "url": "/CTF-writeups-public/writeups/IceCTF-2018/misc-10-hello-world.html", "categories": "misc", "tags": "", "date": "", "snippet": "ChallengeWelcome to the competition!

For today, we are studying basic cryptography and its applications. Cryptography has a long history, although with the advent of computers it has gotten really complicated. Some simple old ciphers are the Caesar cipher, the Vigenere cipher, the substitution cipher, which is this one, and so on. Almost all of these ciphers are easily broken today with the help of computers. Some new encryption methods are AES, the current standard for encryption, along with RSA. Cryptography is a vast field and is very interesting though. So kick back, read up on some cool ciphers and have fun!

Once the pcap file was opened with wireshark, basedon [asuggestion on theinternet][1]I filtered with usb.data_flag == \"present (0)\" && usb.device_address == 21which seemed to filter our enough of just what I wanted, USB interruptsfromthe device to the host. These could be exported to XML where we can lookat the\"Leftover Capture Data\" by extracting that into a separate file: xpath -e '//field[@name=\"usb.capdata\"]/@value' -q cap.xml | grep -v 0000000000000000 > keyboard.data{: .language-console}This file starts to have some semblance of looking like keypresses.E.g.: value=\"2000000000000000\" value=\"20000a0000000000\" value=\"2000000000000000\" value=\"00000c0000000000\" value=\"0000070000000000\" value=\"0200000000000000\" value=\"02000c0000000000\" value=\"0200000000000000\" value=\"02000e0000000000\" value=\"0200000000000000\" value=\"02001c0000000000\"I believe the 20/02 in the leading byte is the shift key, but not sureaboutthe difference between 0x02 and 0x20. You can see the shift key beingpressed,another letter being typed (0x0a), the shift key is still held, thenreleased,two more letters are typed (0x0c, 0x07), shift key is depressed again,andthree individual letters are typed. This looks a LOT like \"IceCTF\"Using the `KEY_CODES` provided by the [helpful person][2],it was possible to dump this as-is, which yielded GIDIKY{ J0-P1V3-X3O7T-4LT4T5}Shoot. But! The braces are in the right place, and dashes are shifted tounderscores. so this looks quite promising. Adding the shift key anddoing somere-mapping, we can get to IceCTF{!j0_p1V3!_x!3O7T_4LT!4t5}Now just a mystery to figure out the rest. I would somewhat believe thattheynumbers are in the right places, since those are the numerals normallyused inleetspeak. The rest of the alphabet shows no discernable pattern.
