## Description

Ever wondered how Santa delivers presents, and knows which groups of
friends should be provided with the best gifts? It should be as great or
as large as possible! Well, here is one way.

Hmm, I cannot seem to read the file either, maybe the internet knows?

[dec10.col.b](writeupfiles/dec10.col.b)

*Hints*

* Hope this cliques for you
* `bin2asc` will help you with this, but ...
* segfaults can be fixed - maybe read the source
* If you are using Windows for this challenge, make sure to add a b to
  to the fopen calls on lines 37 and 58
* There is more than one thing you can do with this type of file! Try
  other options...
* Groups, not group
