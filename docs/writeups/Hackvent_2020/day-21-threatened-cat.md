## Description

You can feed this cat with many different things, but only a certain
kind of file can endanger the cat.

Do you find that kind of files? And if yes, can you use it to disclose
the flag? Ahhh, by the way: The cat likes to hide its stash in
`/usr/bin/catnip.txt`.

Note: The cat is currently in hibernation and will take a few seconds to
wake up.

## Solution
