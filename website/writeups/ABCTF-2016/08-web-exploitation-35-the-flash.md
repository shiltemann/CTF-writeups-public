**Challenge**   
Can you somehow get the flag from this website?

**Solution**   
website with password field, comment in html, base64 decode to get
password, gives flag

    <!-- c3RvcHRoYXRqcw== -->
{: .language-html}

which is `stopthatjs`, entering this in password field gives the flag in
the source
