## Challenge

If you could become admin you would get a flag. <website link="" />

**Solution**  
website said `You're not an admin. Please leave this site.`

Found a cookie containing value `e2FkbWluOmZhbHNlfQ==`, base64 decodes
to `{admin:false}`, change the cookie to `base64("{admin:true}")` and
reload the page gave the flag
