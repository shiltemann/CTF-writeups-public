## Challenge Template

**Challenge**
We have received pictures from the enemy companion of the unknown before
planet. And we haven't thought up anything better, than to construct
DeathStarV3 (the general was a fan of "Star Wars") and to absorb energy of the
whole planet! And again we are pursued by problems: that we don't know
coordinate! Your task is to determine coordinates of this unique planet (which
according to our spy are ciphered in the image). Also he could steal one of the
scripts intended for embedding of coordinates. All hope only for you!

**Solution**
They give you the python code used to encrypt it, pretty simple to reverse the
process and decrypt the key

```python
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open('encrypted.png')
i = img.convert('RGB')

(flag_length, x, y) = i.getpixel((0, 0))

flag = ''

while True:
    (flag_char, new_x, new_y) = i.getpixel((x, y))
    flag += chr(flag_char)
    x = new_x
    y = new_y

    if len(flag) >= flag_length:
        print flag
        break
```
