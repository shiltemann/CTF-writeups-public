**Challenge**
## Solution

We connect to the service using

    $ nc
    nc challenges.hackvent.hacking-lab.com 8888
    Riddle me this, riddle me that. What about solving a bunch of riddles for a present or two?
    0, 1, 1, 2, 3 ... ?
{: .language-bash}

Looks like the fibonacci sequence, let's see what happens if we answer

    5
    ACK, go ahead...
    8
    ACK, go ahead...
    13
    ACK, go ahead...
    14
    RST. Go ask Leonardo for help ...

Ok, seems like we need to keep going with the fibonacci sequence. We
automate it using python:

    import telnetlib

    # generator to produce fibonacci numbers
    a,b = 0,1
    def fibI():
        global a,b
        while True:
            a,b = b, a+b
            yield a

    server = "challenges.hackvent.hacking-lab.com"
    port = 8888

    # get generator to the right point in the sequence
    fib=fibI()
    fib.next()
    fib.next()
    fib.next()
    fib.next()

    print "starting"

    #connect to service
    tn = telnetlib.Telnet(server, port)
    print tn.read_until("\n")
    print tn.read_until("\n")

    # play until we win
    response="ACK, go ahead..."
    while response == "ACK, go ahead...":

        # answer with next in fibonacci sequence
        answer=fib.next()
        print 'answering: '+str(answer)
        tn.write(str(answer))
        tn.write('\n')

        response=tn.read_until('\n').strip('\n')
        print response

    # see what else they have to say
    print tn.read_all()
{: .language-python}

This results in the following exchange:

    You really thought I would give away my precious stuff?
      That was a joke. HAHA. FAT CHANCE.

Ok, this was to easy to be the real challenge, but we did get the
