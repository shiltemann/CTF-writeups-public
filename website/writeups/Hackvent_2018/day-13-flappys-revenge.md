## Challenge

There were some rumors that you were cheating at our little game a few
days ago ... like godmode, huh?

Well, show me that you can do it again - no cheating this time.

Location: telnet whale.hacking-lab.com 4242

## Solution

This was the same game as in [day 7](#day-07-flappy.pl), but now running
on remote server.

This game wasn't too hard to get the hang of, just control the speed of
the dot by hitting space at regular intervals and remember where the
gaps are since they are the same every time. We just played it til the
end?
