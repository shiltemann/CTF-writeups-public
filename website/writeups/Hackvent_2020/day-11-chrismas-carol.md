## Description

Since yesterday's challenge seems to have been a bit on the hard side,
we're adding a small musical innuendo to relax.

My friend Chris from Florida sent me this score. Enjoy! Is this what you
call postmodern?

P.S: Also, we're giving another 24h to get full points for the last
challenge.

*Hints*

* He also sent this image, but that doesn't look like Miami's skyline to
  me.
* The secret code is useful for a file - not a website
