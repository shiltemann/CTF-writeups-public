## Description

Santa loves to keep his personal secrets on a little toy cube he got
from a kid called Bread. Turns out that was not a very good idea. Last
night Rudolph got hold of it and frubl'd it about five times before
spitting it out. Look at it! All the colors have come off! Naughty
Rudolph!

*Hints*

* The flag matches `/^HV20{[a-z3-7_@]+}$/` and is read face by face,
  from left to right, top to bottom
* The cube has been scrambled with ~5 moves in total
* jElf has already started trying to solve the problem, however he got
  lost with all the numbers. Feel free to use his current state if you
  don't want to start from scratch...
