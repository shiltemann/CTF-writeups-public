## Description

Santa has a customized remote control panel for his gift factory at the
north pole. Only clients with the following fingerprint seem to be able
to connect:

`771,49162-49161-52393-49200-49199-49172-49171-52392,0-13-5-11-43-10,23-24,0`

Connect to Santa's super-secret control panel and circumvent its access
controls.

*Hints*

* If you get a 403 forbidden: this is part of the challenge
* The remote control panel does client fingerprinting
* There is an information leak somewhere which you need to solve the
  challenge
* The challenge is not solvable using brute force or injection
  vulnerabilities
* Newlines matter, check your files
