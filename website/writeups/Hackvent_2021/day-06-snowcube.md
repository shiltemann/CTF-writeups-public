## Challenge

The ester bunny sent a gift to Santa - what is usually a crystal sphere
seemed a bit too boring, so it's a cube!

The snow seems to be falling somewhat strangely, is it possible that
there's a message hidden somewhere?

## Solution

I played around with it at first, and judging by the cone of snow
there's clearly a correct viewpoint to view from but it's inaccessible.
Checking the source code if you press `s` it will unbind the camera and
you can rotate it fully to the correct viewpoint. Then all you have to
do is read the text.
