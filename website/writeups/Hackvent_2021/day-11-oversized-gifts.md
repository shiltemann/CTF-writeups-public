## Challenge

To ensure that Santa does not have to carry such a heavy load, our elves
are always trying to shrink the gifts as much as possible. New
technologies are constantly being developed in our laboratories.
Unfortunately, an incident occurred during a test, when restoring the
original size, an error occurred and now we are no longer able to
achieve the original size.

## Solution

https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/deflate.html seems relevant, maybe
something about incorrect deflate flag or so? odd.
