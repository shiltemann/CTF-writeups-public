## Solution

Below are my suspicions on what each bar does

*bar 1:* top bar appears to change with the number of seconds since the
last full minute, so will reach full width every minute.

*bar 2:* was already full for me, number of bars connectivity?

*bar 3:* compass direction. point your phone due north to get full width

*bar 4:* battery charge (charge to full to get to full width)
