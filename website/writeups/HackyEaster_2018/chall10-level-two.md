## Challenge

So you managed to beat the boss in the teaser game? This one won't be that easy!

You'll need [RPG Maker Run Time Packages](http://cached-downloads.degica.com/degica-downloads/RPGVXAce_RTP.zip) to run the game.

Hints: There are several parts to be found. Combine them, and enter the final flag in the egg-o-matic below, without spaces! Saving the game from time to time certainly helps.
