## Challenge

The SERTC (super exciting rabbit travel company) wants to use the latest technology.

They currently employ an experienced guide, which is classifying the visitors into Goodtails and Luckyspoons. For the trained eye of the guide, this is easy. But how do you get a machine to do it (which would be cheaper)?

Go and help them implement a learning algorithm! Their platform is available here:

Since quality is the main concern of SERTC, they expect an accuracy of at least 99%.
