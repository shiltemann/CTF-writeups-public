## Challenge

My Irish friend told me about his new web site. He told me it was in a bucket named egg-in-a-bucket. No clue what that is...

**Solution**

They're an "irish" friend, so, eu-west-1 is the appropriate region: [http://egg-in-a-bucket.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/](http://egg-in-a-bucket.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)
