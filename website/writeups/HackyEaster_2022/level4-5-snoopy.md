## Challenge

Snoopy dog found something interesting.

Can you get something interesting out of the 256 bytes he found?

```
IKIANJKDPKKAPJIDNKKAPNBHELCBHMGGDLOBLIPCKNAHFOEEBNFHALLBOMPGKJADFKDAGMNGIIGCDPEFBINCIPNFIMKGPPLFOMLGOKFAAIECBPJFM</Password>
<Domain type="NT">CORP</Domain>
</Credentials>
<ClientName>THUMPERSDESK7</ClientName>
<ClientType>ica30</ClientType>
<ClientAddress>10.1
```


## Solution

Looks like a CITRIX password, Cyberchef can decode those!

It complains about not being the right length, so we are probably missing some characters at the start of the snippet, so we add `A`s to the beginning until it decrypts

```
ê¶¥.2022{ctx1_41nt_3nKryp710n!}
```

luckily we can guess the start of the string ;)
