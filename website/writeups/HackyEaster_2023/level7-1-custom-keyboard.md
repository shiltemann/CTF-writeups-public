## Challenge

Thumper built his first custom keyboard. He chose all the parts separately and in the end even adjusted the firmware.

Apparently, there's a flag hidden inside it. Can you find it?

[custom_keyboard.elf](writeupfiles/custom_keyboard.elf)

ðŸš© Flag

- lowercase and _ only
- example: `he2023{example_flag_only}`


## Solution
