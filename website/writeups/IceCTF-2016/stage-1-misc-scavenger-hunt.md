## Challenge

There is a flag hidden somewhere on our website, do you think you can
find it? Good luck!

## Solution

Found this via their GitHub page, looked at recent commits and saw one
with commit message `aoeuMyhandsaretypingwords` looked suspicious, saw
they edited the sponsors.html page
(https://github.com/IceCTF/ctf-landing/commit/fe9c68d06680156f32f9963fa8490810e28ebdd2)
