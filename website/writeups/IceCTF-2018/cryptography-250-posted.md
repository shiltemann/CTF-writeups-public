## Challenge

Apparently some bitwise boi is posting flags all over the place. He gave
us a hint, though.

    DychGDZJRRsEUTI0JDViVlxeZyFIBCM7MwosGRQCMCgZJCIrGCsoRkFIajcSKhBTGx9XeTV4MDlZB1Y=

He also gave us another hint: 41

## Solution

base64 decode, then probably one or more bitwise operation (due to
mention of 'bitwise boi' in description), likely involving the number 41
