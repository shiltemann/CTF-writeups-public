## Challenge

Welcome to the competition! To get you started we decided to give you
your first flag. The flags all start with the "IceCTF" and have some
secret message contained with in curly braces "\{" and "}".

Within this platform, the challenges will be shown inside a frame to the
right. For example purposes the download interface is shown on the right
now. For static challenges you will need to click the large button in
order to receive your challenge. For non static challenges, the lab
itself will be shown on the right.

To submit the flag you can click the blue flag button in the bottom
right hand corner.

Your flag is `IceCTF{this_is_a_flag}`

## Solution

`CTRL+C, CTRL+V`

## Flag

    IceCTF{this_is_a_flag}
