## Challenge

Using netcat (nc) will be a necessity throughout your adventure. Can you
connect to `2018shell1.picoctf.com` at port `49387` to get the flag?

## Solution

    $ nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 49387
    That wasn't so hard was it?
    picoCTF{NEtcat_iS_a_NEcESSiTy_8b6a1fbc}
{: .language-bash}
