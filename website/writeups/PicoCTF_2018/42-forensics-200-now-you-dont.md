## Challenge

We heard that there is something hidden in this picture. Can you find
it?

![](writeupfiles/nowYouDont.png)

## Solution

We extract the LSB of each of the colour channels using [this script][1]

and find the flag in the red channel:

    $ python3 extractlsb.py -i nowYouDont.png
{: .language-bash}

This script outputs 3 black-and-white images, each signifying the least
significant bit of each of the 3 RGB channels.

the outputfile for the red channel, `nowYouDont_lsb_r.png`, contained
the flag:
