**Challenge**  
 There is a website running at http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:21579
(link). Try to see if you can push their buttons.

**Solution**  
The first button is a form and the second is an `a href`. Clicking the
second  
link gives a message about being denied. Changing the second button to a
form  
(so it will POST) result in success.
