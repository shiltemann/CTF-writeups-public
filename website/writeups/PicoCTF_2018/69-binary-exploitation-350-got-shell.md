    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <sys/types.h>
    
    void win() {
      system("/bin/sh");
    }
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    
      setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    
      char buf[256];
    
      unsigned int address;
      unsigned int value;
    
      puts("I'll let you write one 4 byte value to memory. Where would you like to write this 4 byte value?");
    
      scanf("%x", &address);
    
      sprintf(buf, "Okay, now what value would you like to write to 0x%x", address);
      puts(buf);
    
      scanf("%x", &value);
    
      sprintf(buf, "Okay, writing 0x%x to 0x%x", value, address);
      puts(buf);
    
      *(unsigned int *)address = value;
    
      puts("Okay, exiting now...\n");
      exit(1);
