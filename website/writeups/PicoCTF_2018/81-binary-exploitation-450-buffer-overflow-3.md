## Challenge

It looks like Dr. Xernon added a stack canary to [this
program](./writeupfiles/vuln-buff-overflow-3) to protect against buffer
overflows. Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag?
You can find it in
/problems/buffer-overflow-3\_2\_810c6904c19a0e8b0da0f59eade5b0ce.
[Source.](./writeupfiles/vuln-buff-overflow-3.c)

## Hints

* Maybe there's a smart way to brute-force the canary?

**Solution**  
I really don't know what to do for this one. That's 4 bytes, large
number of  
options. You can't `gdb` this live, I don't think it's possible to do
timing  
based attacks to guess digits. So... ???
