## Challenge

Apparently our crypto program didn't store the correct phi-value or
something for this message; it spits out gibberish when we try to
decrypt it. Either the memory had a rare fault or Zob's being an idiot
again. Please help.

*Hint* Zob works at the Russian Space Agency

## Solution

From the hint we gather it has something to do with RSA
