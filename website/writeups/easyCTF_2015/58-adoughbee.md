**Challenge**  
ADoughBee Incorporated has released their FlagEncrypt software. But it
seems that unless you unlock the software, you can't really do anything!
I know that evil@anomat.cf has a working license, try to find their
serial number!

The serial is 25 characters long, alphanumeric. When you submit the
flag, don't include easyctf\{}.

**Solution**  
## Flag
