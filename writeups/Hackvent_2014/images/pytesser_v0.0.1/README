Introduction:
============
PyTesser is an Optical Character Recognition module for Python. It takes 
as input an image or image file and outputs a string.

PyTesser uses the Tesseract OCR engine (an Open Source project at Google), 
converting images to an accepted format and calling the Tesseract 
executable as an external script. A Windows executable is provided 
along with the Python scripts. The scripts should work in Linux as well.

Dependencies:
=============
PIL is required to work with images in memory. PyTesser has been tested with Python 2.4 in Windows XP.

Installation:
==============
PyTesser has no installation functionality in this release.  Extract pytesser.zip
into directory with other scripts.  Necessary files are listed in Dependencies below.  


Usage:
================================
>>> from pytesser import *
>>> im = Image.open('phototest.tif')
>>> text = image_to_string(im)
>>> print text
This is a lot of 12 point text to test the
ocr code and see if it works on all types
of file format.
